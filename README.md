# OpenAI-Gym-Copy-V0
A neural network solution to the Copy-V0 environment

A neural network is an inefficient method for mapping such a simple process 
with a small number of discrete inputs and outputs, but I wanted to test it before
applying the neural network to more difficult problems. It plots the average reward per timestep
(maximum possible is 1) against training iterations. Training stops automatically once perfect performance
is achieved over 100 trial games. Close the plot to render the game.
